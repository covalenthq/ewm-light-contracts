2. Write clean, readable, and well-documented code following the project's coding conventions.
3. Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected and do not introduce any new issues.
4. Use `npm run coverage` to test changes for backward compatibility. Look in the `./test` directory for all unit and integrations tests.

6. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message: `git commit -m "Add feature X" or "Fix bug Y"`.
7. Push your changes to your forked repository: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
